## Running the Unit Tests

_(Instructions for how to install the unit testing framework and run the unit tests.)_




## Reflection

Question 1: In this challenge, your `multiply` and `power` functions are only expected to work with inputs that are positive integers or zero. Why would it be difficult to also allow negative numbers and decimals given the constraints of the challenge (i.e. having to perform multiplication by doing addition in a loop)?

Question 2: Why is it important that the functions that we write can gracefully handle invalid inputs instead of just letting the code produce JavaScript errors?

_(Put your reflection answers here.)_

1. i got my multiply function to work with negative numbers, but i couldn't figure out how to do exponents without using division and i'm not doing that shit. it wasn't too hard to do negative numbers on multply, i just had to change the inputs so the loop would give the correct answer

2. it doesn't matter too much in this example, but in larger applications it would suck if the whole code breaks just because it doesn't know what to do in an edge case
